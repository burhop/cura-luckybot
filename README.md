Configurations to get Ultimaker Cura to work with Luckybot food extruder

# Introduction
You can find the latest version of Cura here:  https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura

You can find the luckybot extruder here:  https://www.luckybot.us/

I wanted to use the latest version of Cura without any need to run special gcode as specified in the Luckybot documentation.  This is a set of new configurations for Cura (currently 5.1) that does this.  It is still under development.  Please file a bug report if you run into any problems or when trying this with different printers.  I'm currently using the Ender 3 Pro so lack other machines for test.
